The Wcurve is a new algorithm geared towards sequencing genomes. It sequences in a revoluationary way by generating a 3d visualization of the genome in linear time.

Install Dependencies:

	- libcgal2, libcgal-dev
	- automake1.9
	- libqt4-{dev,core,debug}
	- g++
	
== Notes ==
- Seems as though it doesn't work with qt4. Weird. I have a feeling it's a strange issue with the configure script not realizing qt4 is an acceptable version. Look into it.
